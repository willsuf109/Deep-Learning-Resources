# Deep-Learning-Resources

This repository is to record my the process of learning, it is a working document. It will include:
  1. Questions I have during the learning process. Along with articles that helped me understand these questions and my answers to these questions.
  2. Code for different NN, different architecture
  3. Ideas and areas for further exploration

# Basic Questions

A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Where databases are more complex they are often developed using formal design and modeling techniques.

  - What are the differences between different databases?
  - How are they set up?

When do you use what tools at what time?
Different machine learning/AI/statsitic tools
  - deep neural networks
  - logistic regression
  - reinforcement learning
  - More fundamental statistics

# Deep-Learning-Resources

This repository is to record my the process of learning, it is a working document. It will include:
  1. Questions I have during the learning process. Along with articles that helped me understand these questions and my answers to these questions.
  2. Code for different NN, different architecture
  3. Ideas and areas for further exploration

My Aim: Work My way through these headlines, writing notes for what I learn. 
Step 1: finish course 2 in the deep learning specialisation
